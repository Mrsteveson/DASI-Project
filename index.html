  <h2>Why choose adoption? </h2>
  <p>Adopting a pet can be a big step for any individual. It is a commitment that cannot be taken lightly as it is made between yourself and another living being. Countless adopters underestimate the amount of time and effort needed to rehabilitate some of these animals. Our goal is to provide the services needed to help all adoptions go smoothly and to ensure our adopters are prepared. <span>The whole experience is life changing for yourself and your new companion</span> and we here at DASI are so excited to help you along your way.</p>

  <h3>We are here to help.</h3>
  <p>There are a number of organizations throughout the United States that run shelters and organize foster families for their animals in hopes of starting the rehabilitation/adoption process. Depending on where in the nation you live certain organizations may be more accessible to you. However, some animals and their stories can really connect with individuals and that alone can make the travel distance completely worth every minute.</p>

 <p class="Story1"> Growing up, I worked with both Orphans of the Storm and Tails of Hope as part of a foster family for a number of animals. We had animals such as pregnant cats who ended up giving birth in the guest room bathroom, a one-eyed dog, to even an abandoned gosling with a broken wing that my mother taught to fly. Opening your home to an animal <span class="Story1"> can change your entire outlook on life </span> and it is something I would personally recommend to anyone if they are able. I promise you won't regret it and if you need help, we at DASI are here for you.</p>
